Joint Estimation of Dictionary and Image (from compressive samples)

This is the source code for my paper that is under revision in IEEE-Transactions on Computaational Imaging.

I use [SPAMS](https://github.com/samuelstjean/spams-python) for LASSO optimization. Link to the SPAMS library is in the `/lib/` directory.
